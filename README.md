Wex
===

Wex is an IEx-like utility that runs code in the browser.

This gives us some interesting possibilities: popup windows for help,
asynchronous output, continuous compilation with errors and warnings
flagged in the source, and so on.

This is at best a prototype, so tread lightly. But, if you feel like
contributing, there is a list of things to do on the issues page.

To run Wex:

1. `git clone https://github.com/pragdave/wex.git`
2. `cd wex`
3. `bower install`
4. `mix deps.get`
6. `mix run --no-halt`
7. Browse to [localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)

Enjoy
